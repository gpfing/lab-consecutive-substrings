Loop through the given string until all possible combinations have been found

1. Start at the first character in the given string and push it to a block variable array
2. Add one character at a time and push it to the block variable
3. Once the string has been fully parsed, change the starting point to be one character deeper
4. Do this until we start our loop at the final character in the string

To do this, we will use a nested For Loop within a For Loop

To properly push the string to the array, we will use slice() on the string
